## Machine Learning Categories

Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be grouped into 2 categories:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning

These two categories in turn can be further subdivided:
1. Supervised Learning
    - Classification Models
    - Regression Models
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering


## Machine Learning Algorithm Classification

Exact categories for each ML algorithm are as follows:
1. Supervised Learning
    - Classification Models
        - Decision Trees
        - K-Nearest Neighbors
        - Naive Bayes
        - Nearest Neighbor
        - Neural Networks
        - Random Forest
        - Support Vector Machines
    - Regression Models
        - Ensemble Methods
        - Gaussian Process Regression
        - Linear Regression
        - Logistic Regression
        - Support Vector Regression
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering
        - K-Means Clustering
        - Fuzzy Means Clustering
        - Gaussian Mixture
        - Hidden Markov Model
    - Dimensionality Reduction
    - Anomaly Detection


## When To Use Each ML Algorithm

1. Supervised Learning
    - Classification Models: Used to predict a categorical variable
        - 
    - Regression Models: Used to predict continuous values
        - Linear Regression
            - Model a continuous relationship between x and y
        - Logistic Regression
            - Categorial classification between two options
2. Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering
        - Used to cluster data into groups that are more similar within the set
    - Dimensionality Reduction
        - Used to reduce the number of variables
